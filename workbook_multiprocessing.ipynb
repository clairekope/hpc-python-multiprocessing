For the following walkthrough, we'll be distributing something more abstract - runs of a Monte Carlo algorithm. Broadly speaking, Monte Carlo algorithms rely on random sampling to generate a result. We'll be using a Monte Carlo method to approximate the value of $\\pi$.\n",

    "We can estimate the area of these two shapes by randomly selecting points, say within $-1 \\le x \\le 1$ and $-1 \\le y \\le 1$. By construction, all of the points will fall inside a square with $r=1$, so the area of the square is approximately the total number of points we have sampled. Then, we can count the number of points that fall inside the circle $x^2 + y^2 \\le 1$. This number is approximately the area of the circle. Therefore,\n",

The math to approximate $\\pi$ remains the same, but our random points now more efficiently cover the area of the quadrant.\n",
